# Inverse Kinematics Lib using Fabrik
This is an easy-to-use library for the StarfallEx gmod addon. This will hopefully be the best way to create mechs in gmod.
I created this library due to the fact that It was hard to make mechs and such, seeing that there were no ik libraries, 
I took matters into my own hands and created this library for all to use! Have fun working with this, and be sure to let me know of any features I should add!
